# Team Approach:
We approached this by deciding to work semi-individually initially, with all of us testing our own methods to combine our methods and choose what works
best in the end.

# Skills:
- Dom: CSS/JS
- Sweta: JS/HTML
- Jinbo : CSS

# How To Run:
The following commands need to be run for the project
a) Getting npm
1.npm -v

Find the latest version of npm or install it here http://nodejs.org.
b) Getting Oracle JET
In this part, you install the Oracle JET command-line interface.

Install the Oracle JET command-line interface:
npm install -g @oracle/ojet-cli
Run the following to check installation succeeded and to see the available commands:
ojet help

Run the following to check that you have the correct version of Oracle JET:
ojet --version
You should see this:

Oracle JET Command Line Interface, version: 6.2.0
Tip: If the above shows that you have an earlier version of the Oracle JET command-line interface, i.e., below 6.2.0, please reinstall, using the command in step 1 above to do so.

You are now ready to get started with Oracle JET!

(c) Creating an Oracle JET Application
Run the following in the terminal:
ojet create Assignment7 --template=navdrawer
Note: This process may take some time.

Delete the Assignment7 folder that was just created and paste OUR Assignment7 folder in it's place.

CD into 'Assignment7' in the terminal:
cd Assignment7
...and then run the following in the terminal and look in the browser:

ojet serve
